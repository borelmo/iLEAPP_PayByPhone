Supports iOS/iPadOS 11, 12, 13 and 14, 15, 16.
Select parsing directly from a compressed .tar/.zip file, or a decompressed directory, or an iTunes/Finder backup folder.

## Features

Parses:  
⚙️ Mobile Installation Logs  
⚙️ iOS 12+ Notifications  
⚙️ Build Info (iOS version, etc.)  
⚙️ Wireless cellular service info (IMEI, number, etc.)  
⚙️ Screen icons list by screen and in grid order.  
⚙️ ApplicationState.db support for app bundle ID to data container GUID correlation.   
⚙️ User and computer names that the iOS device connected to. Function updated by Jack Farley (@JackFarley248, http://farleyforensics.com/).  
etc...

## Requirements

Python 3.9 to latest version (older versions of 3.x will also work with the exception of one or two modules)
If on macOS (Intel) make sure Xcode is installed and have command line tools updated to be able to use Python 3.11. 

### Dependencies

Dependencies for your python environment are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using the below command. Ensure 
the `py` part is correct for your environment, eg `py`, `python`, or `python3`, etc. 

`py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`  
or  
 `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

To run on **Linux**, you will also need to install `tkinter` separately like so:

`sudo apt-get install python3-tk`

To install on Windows follow the guide, courtesy of Hexordia, here:

## Compile to executable

To compile to an executable so you can run this on a system without python installed.
If using Python 3.10 and above delete the arguments from the following terminal commands.

*Windows OS*

To create ileapp.exe, run:

```
pyinstaller --onefile ileapp.spec
```

To create ileappGUI.exe, run:

```
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole ileappGUI.spec
```

*macOS*

To create ileapp, run:

```
pyinstaller --onefile ileapp_macOS.spec
```

To create ileappGUI.app, run:

```
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed ileappGUI_macOS.spec
```

## Usage

### CLI

```
$ python ileapp.py -t <zip | tar | fs | gz> -i <path_to_extraction> -o <path_for_report_output>
```

### GUI

```
$ python ileappGUI.py 
```

### Help

```
$ python ileapp.py --help
```

## Contributing artifact plugins

Each plugin is a Python source file which should be added to the `scripts/artifacts` folder which will be loaded dynamically each time ILEAPP is run.

The plugin source file must contain a dictionary named `__artifacts_v2__` at the very beginning of the module, which defines the artifacts that the plugin processes. The keys in the `__artifacts_v2__` dictionary should be IDs for the artifact(s) which must be unique within ILEAPP. The values should be dictionaries containing the following keys:

- `name`: The name of the artifact as a string.
- `description`: A description of the artifact as a string.
- `author`: The author of the plugin as a string.
- `version`: The version of the artifact as a string.
- `date`: The date of the last update to the artifact as a string.
- `requirements`: Any requirements for processing the artifact as a string.
- `category`: The category of the artifact as a string.
- `notes`: Any additional notes as a string.
- `paths`: A tuple of strings containing glob search patterns to match the path of the data that the plugin expects for the artifact.
- `function`: The name of the function which is the entry point for the artifact's processing as a string.

For example:

```python
__artifacts_v2__ = {
    "cool_artifact_1": {
        "name": "Cool Artifact 1",
        "description": "Extracts cool data from database files",
        "author": "@username",
        "version": "0.1",
        "date": "2022-10-25",
        "requirements": "none",
        "category": "Really cool artifacts",
        "notes": "",
        "paths": ('*/com.android.cooldata/databases/database*.db',),
        "function": "get_cool_data1"
    },
    "cool_artifact_2": {
        "name": "Cool Artifact 2",
        "description": "Extracts cool data from XML files",
        "author": "@username",
        "version": "0.1",
        "date": "2022-10-25",
        "requirements": "none",
        "category": "Really cool artifacts",
        "notes": "",
        "paths": ('*/com.android.cooldata/files/cool.xml',),
        "function": "get_cool_data2"
    }
}
```

The functions referenced as entry points in the `__artifacts__` dictionary must take the following arguments:

* An iterable of the files found which are to be processed (as strings)
* The path of ILEAPP's output folder(as a string)
* The seeker (of type FileSeekerBase) which found the files
* A Boolean value indicating whether or not the plugin is expected to wrap text

For example:

```python
def get_cool_data1(files_found, report_folder, seeker, wrap_text):
    pass  # do processing here
```

Plugins are generally expected to provide output in ILEAPP's HTML output format, TSV, and optionally submit records to 
the timeline. Functions for generating this output can be found in the `artifact_report` and `ilapfuncs` modules. 
At a high level, an example might resemble:

```python
__artifacts_v2__ = {
    "cool_artifact_1": {
        "name": "Cool Artifact 1",
        "description": "Extracts cool data from database files",
        "author": "@username",  # Replace with the actual author's username or name
        "version": "0.1",  # Version number
        "date": "2022-10-25",  # Date of the latest version
        "requirements": "none",
        "category": "Really cool artifacts",
        "notes": "",
        "paths": ('*/com.android.cooldata/databases/database*.db',),
        "function": "get_cool_data1"
    }
}

import datetime
from scripts.artifact_report import ArtifactHtmlReport
import scripts.ilapfuncs

def get_cool_data1(files_found, report_folder, seeker, wrap_text):
    # let's pretend we actually got this data from somewhere:
    rows = [
     (datetime.datetime.now(), "Cool data col 1, value 1", "Cool data col 1, value 2", "Cool data col 1, value 3"),
     (datetime.datetime.now(), "Cool data col 2, value 1", "Cool data col 2, value 2", "Cool data col 2, value 3"),
    ]
    
    headers = ["Timestamp", "Data 1", "Data 2", "Data 3"]
    
    # HTML output:
    report = ArtifactHtmlReport("Cool stuff")
    report_name = "Cool DFIR Data"
    report.start_artifact_report(report_folder, report_name)
    report.add_script()
    report.write_artifact_data_table(headers, rows, files_found[0])  # assuming only the first file was processed
    report.end_artifact_report()
    
    # TSV output:
    scripts.ilapfuncs.tsv(report_folder, headers, rows, report_name, files_found[0])  # assuming first file only
    
    # Timeline:
    scripts.ilapfuncs.timeline(report_folder, report_name, rows, headers)

```
